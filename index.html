		<p>
		Great stories are everywhere, especially in sports. The reason I want to pursue sports journalism is to continue to find and tell great stories. These are a few of my favorite examples.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Telling Stories With Data</h2>
		<p>I'm always striving to find ways to combine my math and journalism backgrounds, and I think the best way to tell a story is often by using data. It is difficult to strike the careful balance in using numbers in ways that everyone can understand. Here are some examples of my numbers-based writing:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://wnursports.com/2019/07/29/what-can-advanced-metrics-tell-us-about-big-ten-softball/" target="new">What Can Advanced Metrics Tell Us About Big Ten Softball?</a> -- My friend and I created and calculated advanced metrics for all of 2019 Big Ten softball, and I wrote about the biggest takeaways from the data</li>
		<li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/zack-greinkes-8-pitch-types-keep-em-guessing/" target="new">Zack Greinke's 8 Pitch Types Keem 'Em Guessing</a> -- At the age of 35, when most pichers are well past their prime, Greinke remains among MLB's best pitchers. He does so by constantly revamping his arsenal, which has become a unique one, as he chases his first World Series</li>
		<li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-all-stars-since-2002/" target="new">The Worst All-Stars Since 2002</a> -- Sandy Alcantara of the Marlins was named an All-Star this year despite a 3.82 ERA. How does he compare to other "bad" All-Stars, and what can we learn about how subpar players are given honors?</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/02/25/pittsburgh-pirates-season-projections-trevor-williams-jameson-taillon-corey-dickerson/stories/201902250016" target="new">Numbers game: Why are the Pirates projected to be so average in 2019?</a> -- Before the 2019 season, three different projection systems all projected the Pirates win 79 or 80 games. How do they come to these predictions, and why do they all agree on Pittsburgh's mediocrity?</li>
		<li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-marlins-traded-away-a-playoff-team/" target="new">The Marlins Traded Away A Playoff Team</a> -- In a fun exercise (and not necessarily an indictment of the current leadership) I assemble a roster of former Miami Marlins trade pieces, and find that it would be one of the best teams in the league</li>
